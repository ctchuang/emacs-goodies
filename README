0. You need Emacs 24 to use Zenburn theme.

  Ubuntu 12.04 doesn't come with the latest Emacs package, please build it manually.
  Ubuntu 14.04 already has built-in Emacs 24, this step is no longer necessary.

  You can build Emacs 24 on Linux.

  $ aptitude install -y libgtk2.0-dev libxpm-dev libtiff-dev libgif-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libncurses-dev libxml2-dev
  $ ./configure --with-x-toolkit=gtk
  $ make        (check if src/emacs works)
  $ sudo make install

1. git clone emacs-goodies in any path

   $ git clone https://code.google.com/p/emacs-goodies/

2. Setup instructions

   $ ln -s <path>/emacs-goodies/dot-emacs $HOME/.emacs

3. Zenburn theme

   - This package comes with a customized version of Emacs zenburn theme.

     - Tweaked to use a darker background color (#202020) and support outline
       mode.

     - Upstream version is at http://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs

   - zenburn/Zenburn_Mac_Terminal.terminal

     Import Zenburn theme profile setting in Mac Terminal.

     (Tip: install DejaVu Mono fonts from http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Download)

   - zenburn/gnome-terminal-zenburn.sh

     Install Zenburn theme for Gnome Terminal.

4. Emacs Key Bindings in Mac OS X

   Copy DefaultKeyBinding.dict to ~/Library/KeyBindings/ 
   (Create the folder it it doesn't exist)

   Then you can use most common Emacs keybindings in Mac apps (ex: Gmail on
   Chrome).

5. Sample Karabiner settings optimized for Mac key bindings in Linux.

   This is aux setting with Karabiner that cannot be accomplished with in
   standard .emacs and DefaultKeyBinding.dict.

   You need to install Karabiner in Mac OS X and
   $ ln -s <path>/emacs-goodies/Karabiner.xml \
     ~/Libray/Application Support/Karabiner/private.xml

6. Emacs keybindings for tig

   $ ln -s <path>/emacs-goodies/dot-tigrc $HOME/.tigrc

7. Sample .bashrc

   Check samples/doc-bashrc-sample for some tricks like fixing Ctrl+S in terminal.

8. Sample ~/.emacs.d/local-setting.el  (machine-local settings)

   We can put machine-local settings in this file separately while keeping
   common .emacs shared between machines.

   Check samples/local-setting.el-sample

9. Sample .muttrc setting

   In your ~/.muttrc, add
   source <path>/emacs-goodies/dot-muttrc

10. Misc tools

   a. Prettify Emacs outline mode text:

      $ tools/prettify-outline.py < outline.txt
